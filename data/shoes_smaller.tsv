Junk, they are falling apart. The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel. My previous pair from the same company lasted 5 years before I threw them out.  I'm sorry I didn't wear them more often when I first got them as I would have returned them immediately	2015-08-31

(wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!! (yes they are a little on the narrow side, just be aware)	2015-08-31

They were just okay, I ordered too big which was my own fault but I really didn't like the look of them all that much anyway once I got them. Not enough arch support for me, personally. Width was good, I have a wide foot. I'm kind of glad I didn't order the right size because I would have probably kept them. I am so much happier with the Asics I bought instead- I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. These shoes felt a little stiff like cardboard.	2015-08-31

These boots have the typical timberland comfort.  They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.	2015-08-31

I was actually very impressed with this little bag. I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.	2015-08-31

So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.	2015-08-31

Fit as expected (they always run 1/2 size small).  I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them). I still have second pair in the box.	2015-08-31

Bought these as a &#34;one pair does everything&#34; traveling shoe. After the first month of ownership and the first week-long trip I'm really satisfied. Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last. (Hopefully this pair will be much better than the Keens they replaced.)	2015-08-31

I love them. They mold to your feet and give great support. I wear them all year round. This pair, however, seemed to be a bit larger. My toes are sneaking out over the top edge and they are the same size I always get. I have never had that problem before.

I bought these to wear at work (because I worked in a greenhouse, wet feet was an issue) and they were perfect for that because they were made to be wet, had  some traction, and protected my whole foot. When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over. However, after less than a month of wearing them they began to rip apart at the seams. Sort of disappointing, I was hoping they would last a bit longer. Maybe I was expecting too much, to hope that a $35 pair of shoes would last for more than a month.	2015-08-31

Keds aren't known as an orthotic shoe so this is not unexpected. The ortholite footbed does almost nothing. The sole is thin so you can feel the unevenness of the ground/ pavement when you are out walking. For this reason, I would never recommend these shoes for walking. To run around to stores or anywhere indoors, they are fine as long as you add your own support inserts. I could not wear them for any extended period of time without my own insert.	2015-08-31
