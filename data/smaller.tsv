Note- Does not Fit Epiphone SG Special! Mine is circa 2002 model and it will not fill the space between the humbuckers completely. Everything else is Great and good craftmanship otherwise.

Priceless!	I am always looking for unique items that will WOW my grandchildren when they come to visit. This Magic Ball light is fun; it fills a room or tent with light and the automatic sound activation has my Grandchildren singing their hearts out, then giggling and laughing. Priceless!<br /><br />This has been thoroughly tested and approved by all of my grandchildren over the last couple of months and never seems to lose its appeal. It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesn’t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch. I have it plugged into a surge protector with a switch on it so it is not constantly being plugged in and unplugged.<br /><br />Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review.	2015-08-31

Without front roller the break angle for the strings is pretty shallow. if you are an aggressive player you are going to be knocking some strings out of  saddle slots.  You may want to consider a Bigsby with front roller to increase string angle.	2015-08-31

I originally bought my LPM that was of a lighter color, it was brown , same as the color in the back... And it had the hologram in the back... I recently returned it because the finish was chiping, and they gave me a new one that is waaaay darker in color, and it does not have the hologram in the back, is this because it's older? The manufacture date says 9/14 ... Is that on the older side ? Did I get one that is not fully featured? Now I regret returning the original guitar I fell in love with.../:/  Awesome, amazing guitar... Blown away by the quality and attention to detail... And of course... The SOUND! But mine, I got a chip on the finish and I swear that happened inside the case... I had just cleaned it and it was all perfect, then I took it out and it had a big ol chip.... Such a shame, very beautiful finish	2015-08-31

They are very comfortable I've worn them for hours at a time and theyve never bothered me. They are well built and not flimsy at all.  The extra cords really come in handy as well.

I was originally looking at the cheapest mandolin available (won't mention any names) and based on recommendations from players on mandolin blog and chat sites decided to go one level up. Boy am I glad I did because I found this beauty. I found the fit and finish on this mandolin outstanding with no blemishes. The Tabaco sunburst is subdued compared to a standard sunburst, I like that. It only needed a quick tuning and intonation setup and it was ready to play. A real bonus is its amp and recording ready. The picture shows what appears to be a standard single coil magnetic pickup but mine came with a under saddle piezio pickup and it sounds great amped. Make no mistake, this is an entry level mandolin but that is exactly what I wanted as I wasn't sure if I would continue to play it for the long term. Now I'm sure I will continue to play this mandolin frequently and hopefully for a very long time.	2015-08-31

The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI preamp is a must-have if you play an acoustic/electric guitar. The difference in tone from an under-saddle pickup or sound-hole pickup is simply amazing! You DO actually get a microphone sound and any piezo pickup &#34;quack&#34; or electronic-produced sound can be blended out of your guitar's pickup. I have Takamine acoustic-electric guitars and Guild acoustic-electric guitars and they sound exceptional when plugged into this preamp. Before you purchase this preamp, go to Fishman's website (http://www.fishman.com/products/view/aura-spectrum-di) and review the product information and then download the Aura Gallery III to your computer and scan through all the selections available to you for use with your guitar. Some very high-end microphones were used by Fishman to develop this imaging preamp ($4,000 microphones in some cases). Also, browse Youtube to find out more about this preamp....you won't regret your purchase of this preamp. One additional bit of advise......before you decide to spend money for a new guitar, buy this preamp and &#34;dial in&#34; some images to play through your old guitar. I think you'll find that you won't need a new guitar after having a chance to hear your old guitar plugged into this preamp and run through your PA or amplifier.  If you want your acoustic-electric guitar to sound like it is being recorded in a studio with high-end microphones, this is your preamp!	2015-08-31

Tremolo harmonicas are everywhere, but not octave harmonicas.  So I bought this, for just a couple dollars, so see what an octave harmonica sounded like.  The quality of this is not very good, with some notes not playing the upper octave, and it takes a LOT of air to play.  So much so that it is hard to sustain a note for even a full second.  I really don't see this as a playable instrument, and to give this to a beginner would probably just frustrate them.  I did end up buying another octave harmonica by Tombo, and the difference was like night and day... much easier to play.... but also much more expensive.  In hindsight I probably wasted my money on this, but maybe I might take it apart someday and see if I can get it to pay properly.	2015-08-31

The guitar has excellent finish and nice finish on the frets no ruff edges nice. would of gave more stars but the action on the strings was way to high tried to lower them and the hit the pickup. Could not be lowed enough it would come undone from the pickup and still to high it still hit the strings. I had to use a pickup mounting plate that I had. The one I had was vintage witch matched the binding great and is much lower in height then the black one that came with it. The bridge is slammed  down to the bottom and still the strings are to high. Looking for a lower bridge, but it is now playable. It is a great looking guitar much better looking then any Fender squire, vintage or standard or other wise. Just has cheep bridge hardware. the bridge design is bad with the hardware used. The pickup are not that great sound cheep. will be changing them as well. Then I will have the Tele of my dreams	2015-08-31

First I must comment on all the reviews stating that this is a &#34;REAL iRIG!!!&#34;  That is not a review of the quality of the product.  Only the name printed on it.  Who cares if it's a real iRig if it's still crap?<br /><br />The one I got did come in an iRig package if that for some reason matters to you.  But it cracks a lot while recording and there almost no isolation between the headphones and microphone.  So expect anything sent to your headphones (like maybe a metronome click track) to also be recorded (at a slightly lower volume than your actual input).<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is really cheap, so I don't feel like I was really ripped off.  It may have some limited uses for someone out there.	2015-08-31

This required a very narrow and carefully shaped stream of air.<br /><br />It's hard to be sure-- an experienced player might be able to get much nicer sounds out of it-- but I think it is a fairly limited instrument for beginners. In comparison, you can buy a plastic soprano recorder for anywhere from about 3 or 4 dollars to about 30 dollars. A 30-dollar plastic soprano recorder is a very good instrument, better than wood recorders up to five times as expensive. A 5-dollar plastic recorder is a toy-- even the best of recorder players can't really make music on it. I suspect that this danso is comparable in quality to a low-end plastic recorder, but I don't really know that for sure, not having played a better instrument. It doesn't seem capable of much variation in loudness or tone color.	2015-08-31

What a great product!  You can adjust the record levels so (my grand piano) your sound source does not overwhelm the device and cause crackles in the playback.  You can also record as .mp3 at varying levels of precision (ie memory space), same for .wav.  And you can convert one to the other within the device.  The visual interface is not that user friendly, but the user manual is comprehensive.  And you can download onto your PC and upload onto iTunes, creating your own playlists of your playing or send .mp3s to friends or teachers over email to let them hear your progress.  Plus just listening to myself from a recording is so edifying.  I love this little device.  Came fast and free with Prime.  Thanks Amazon!	2015-08-31

I bought two to use with the Monoprice 110951 PA system and the worked great. No background noise was heard through them, just the person singing or talking. Loved that you can turn them off and on, a big plus.  My son-in-law made a nice comment about them and informed me that these are top quality mics and wish he had some like that for his karaoke set up.	2015-08-31

The strap works just fine and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Only problem is that the string it comes with is not durable at all. It snapped literally 5 minutes after I first set it up and started playing it. But that was fine, as the main product is the strap and I had more durable string lying around the house.	2015-08-31

Compared to your typical vandoren box with 3-4 good reeds, it's more like 7-8 with Rigotti. Very even tone across all ranges and no chips breaks or moldy cane. If you play with cane, thsee are the reeds to get.	2015-08-31

I bought the volca bass by mistake (I was actually looking for the volca sample for my project), but damn that thing was the best - excellent fat bass sounds, beautiful tweets, far easier to use and get started than the volca keys, far more responsive to just noodling around to get improvised bass-lines. The only thing I'd change about it is to have a midi-out as standard (there are mod-kits to add this) and have SD-card capabilities to expand the pattern memory options.	2015-08-31
