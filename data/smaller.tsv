Note- Does not Fit Epiphone SG Special! Mine is circa 2002 model and it will not fill the space between the humbuckers completely. Everything else is Great and good craftmanship otherwise.

Priceless!	I am always looking for unique items that will WOW my grandchildren when they come to visit. This Magic Ball light is fun; it fills a room or tent with light and the automatic sound activation has my Grandchildren singing their hearts out, then giggling and laughing. Priceless!<br /><br />This has been thoroughly tested and approved by all of my grandchildren over the last couple of months and never seems to lose its appeal. It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesn’t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch. I have it plugged into a surge protector with a switch on it so it is not constantly being plugged in and unplugged.<br /><br />Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review.	2015-08-31

Without front roller the break angle for the strings is pretty shallow. if you are an aggressive player you are going to be knocking some strings out of  saddle slots.  You may want to consider a Bigsby with front roller to increase string angle.	2015-08-31

I originally bought my LPM that was of a lighter color, it was brown , same as the color in the back... And it had the hologram in the back... I recently returned it because the finish was chiping, and they gave me a new one that is waaaay darker in color, and it does not have the hologram in the back, is this because it's older? The manufacture date says 9/14 ... Is that on the older side ? Did I get one that is not fully featured? Now I regret returning the original guitar I fell in love with.../:/  Awesome, amazing guitar... Blown away by the quality and attention to detail... And of course... The SOUND! But mine, I got a chip on the finish and I swear that happened inside the case... I had just cleaned it and it was all perfect, then I took it out and it had a big ol chip.... Such a shame, very beautiful finish	2015-08-31

They are very comfortable I've worn them for hours at a time and theyve never bothered me. They are well built and not flimsy at all.  The extra cords really come in handy as well.

I was originally looking at the cheapest mandolin available (won't mention any names) and based on recommendations from players on mandolin blog and chat sites decided to go one level up. Boy am I glad I did because I found this beauty. I found the fit and finish on this mandolin outstanding with no blemishes. The Tabaco sunburst is subdued compared to a standard sunburst, I like that. It only needed a quick tuning and intonation setup and it was ready to play. A real bonus is its amp and recording ready. The picture shows what appears to be a standard single coil magnetic pickup but mine came with a under saddle piezio pickup and it sounds great amped. Make no mistake, this is an entry level mandolin but that is exactly what I wanted as I wasn't sure if I would continue to play it for the long term. Now I'm sure I will continue to play this mandolin frequently and hopefully for a very long time.	2015-08-31

The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI preamp is a must-have if you play an acoustic/electric guitar. The difference in tone from an under-saddle pickup or sound-hole pickup is simply amazing! You DO actually get a microphone sound and any piezo pickup &#34;quack&#34; or electronic-produced sound can be blended out of your guitar's pickup. I have Takamine acoustic-electric guitars and Guild acoustic-electric guitars and they sound exceptional when plugged into this preamp. Before you purchase this preamp, go to Fishman's website (http://www.fishman.com/products/view/aura-spectrum-di) and review the product information and then download the Aura Gallery III to your computer and scan through all the selections available to you for use with your guitar. Some very high-end microphones were used by Fishman to develop this imaging preamp ($4,000 microphones in some cases). Also, browse Youtube to find out more about this preamp....you won't regret your purchase of this preamp. One additional bit of advise......before you decide to spend money for a new guitar, buy this preamp and &#34;dial in&#34; some images to play through your old guitar. I think you'll find that you won't need a new guitar after having a chance to hear your old guitar plugged into this preamp and run through your PA or amplifier.  If you want your acoustic-electric guitar to sound like it is being recorded in a studio with high-end microphones, this is your preamp!	2015-08-31

Tremolo harmonicas are everywhere, but not octave harmonicas.  So I bought this, for just a couple dollars, so see what an octave harmonica sounded like.  The quality of this is not very good, with some notes not playing the upper octave, and it takes a LOT of air to play.  So much so that it is hard to sustain a note for even a full second.  I really don't see this as a playable instrument, and to give this to a beginner would probably just frustrate them.  I did end up buying another octave harmonica by Tombo, and the difference was like night and day... much easier to play.... but also much more expensive.  In hindsight I probably wasted my money on this, but maybe I might take it apart someday and see if I can get it to pay properly.	2015-08-31

The guitar has excellent finish and nice finish on the frets no ruff edges nice. would of gave more stars but the action on the strings was way to high tried to lower them and the hit the pickup. Could not be lowed enough it would come undone from the pickup and still to high it still hit the strings. I had to use a pickup mounting plate that I had. The one I had was vintage witch matched the binding great and is much lower in height then the black one that came with it. The bridge is slammed  down to the bottom and still the strings are to high. Looking for a lower bridge, but it is now playable. It is a great looking guitar much better looking then any Fender squire, vintage or standard or other wise. Just has cheep bridge hardware. the bridge design is bad with the hardware used. The pickup are not that great sound cheep. will be changing them as well. Then I will have the Tele of my dreams	2015-08-31

First I must comment on all the reviews stating that this is a &#34;REAL iRIG!!!&#34;  That is not a review of the quality of the product.  Only the name printed on it.  Who cares if it's a real iRig if it's still crap?<br /><br />The one I got did come in an iRig package if that for some reason matters to you.  But it cracks a lot while recording and there almost no isolation between the headphones and microphone.  So expect anything sent to your headphones (like maybe a metronome click track) to also be recorded (at a slightly lower volume than your actual input).<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is really cheap, so I don't feel like I was really ripped off.  It may have some limited uses for someone out there.	2015-08-31

This required a very narrow and carefully shaped stream of air.<br /><br />It's hard to be sure-- an experienced player might be able to get much nicer sounds out of it-- but I think it is a fairly limited instrument for beginners. In comparison, you can buy a plastic soprano recorder for anywhere from about 3 or 4 dollars to about 30 dollars. A 30-dollar plastic soprano recorder is a very good instrument, better than wood recorders up to five times as expensive. A 5-dollar plastic recorder is a toy-- even the best of recorder players can't really make music on it. I suspect that this danso is comparable in quality to a low-end plastic recorder, but I don't really know that for sure, not having played a better instrument. It doesn't seem capable of much variation in loudness or tone color.	2015-08-31

What a great product!  You can adjust the record levels so (my grand piano) your sound source does not overwhelm the device and cause crackles in the playback.  You can also record as .mp3 at varying levels of precision (ie memory space), same for .wav.  And you can convert one to the other within the device.  The visual interface is not that user friendly, but the user manual is comprehensive.  And you can download onto your PC and upload onto iTunes, creating your own playlists of your playing or send .mp3s to friends or teachers over email to let them hear your progress.  Plus just listening to myself from a recording is so edifying.  I love this little device.  Came fast and free with Prime.  Thanks Amazon!	2015-08-31

My eyesight isn't great, especially in dim light. I really like everything about it. The large black face with white numbers and hands makes it so easy to read. The Indiglo light makes it perfect for me. The style, with an adjustable leather band, contrasting white stitching and silver color casing, is very appealing. It was more than $10.00 below retail. At $36.99 you can't beat the value. To me, Timex has always been one of the most reliable and durable brand on the market. I don't need an expensive watch for a status symbol. I just want an attractive watch that tells me the time accurately and is dependable. Timex still makes a great watch at an excellent price.	2015-08-31

So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one. But this one again, is awesome!	2015-08-31

The unscrupulous seller tried to say I didn't align the 24-hour dial with the main display but I did. Despite the inconvenience I learned that I really loved how this watch looks and wanted to replace it ASAP!<br /><br />Anyhow, over a month in to the one I ordered on sale from amazon and I couldn't be happier. It keeps excellent time, losing only one-minute every 4-5 days. The date wheel works as it should, and the compliments keep pouring in.<br /><br />I can't afford a $26K Hublot with industrial rise gold appointments, but this sub-$200 Diesel has to be one of the best values around. I love its sculpted dials and the large display is easy to read, along with luminescent accents when the lights go out. The leather band is glove soft and I do believe that this will last me many years. I like the chronograph option too and am getting used to using it for various applications.<br /><br />All-in-all, a killer watch! Highly recommended!!!	2015-08-31

This makes reading time easy which is important to me.  The hands are glow in the dark.  The wristband is skinny making it feminine looking.  By the way it looks, you can tell that it is a good quality watch.  This watch is perfect for me.	2015-08-31

I have found the need to replace it at least once a year, not because of the watch, but because the band inevitably breaks.  After reading several reviews with the same complaint, I contacted Timex customer service: custserv@timex.com.<br /><br />Timex replied the same day and offered to fix or replace the watch for $10.  They sent instructions along with a pre-paid mailing label so I could send the watch and check.  By the next week, I had a new watch.<br /><br />The inconvenience is a pain, but I was impressed with their customer service and am happy to have my tried and true watch back without having to purchase a brand new one.	2015-08-31

No doubt, sweet looking watches with tons of great features.  However, those watches are either too big or too expensive, or both.<br /><br />Enter the SGW-100.  Almost the same features as its more expensive siblings, but at a fraction of the cost.  Also, the size is much more reasonable.  Not too big (and ridiculous), not too small.  And it has a real backlight, not the weak 1980's amber LED light that shines from the bottom left corner, like too many lower price Casio's.	2015-08-31

It's a nice-looking watch with high-visibility numbers and hands.  Setting the time was easy, and it's keeping accurate time.  The band seems rugged.  I haven't done anything abusive to it yet, so I don't know how the crystal will hold up (the super-hard crystal was one thing I loved about my troublesome old watch).  The Casio does not have a screw-down crown to keep out moisture, but I've been wearing it in the shower with no signs of moisture problems yet.  So, all-in-all, I'm quite pleased with the watch, especially for the price.  I didn't give it five stars because, really, how much can you love a cheap watch like this?  But in terms of value for the money, it's definitely looking like five stars so far.	2015-08-31

German BUND Leatherstrap	Watches	5	9	10	N	Y	Quality watch for under $300	Have had this watch for one week and am very pleased with it so far.  It is my first automatic watch and is more accurate than I expected.. I have been recording times with an app called WatchCheck, from Google Play Store, and over the last week it is only running fast by just over 6 seconds (an average of 0.9 sec/day per the app).  It runs slightly fast when wearing and slightly slow when off and laid vertical with 3:00 up.  They seem to cancel out very well.<br />It is very light thanks to the titanium construction.<br />I cannot comment on the water resistance of the watch since I have not exposed it to water, It does have a screw in crown that seems sturdy.<br />Some things I suggest for future models:<br />a) a larger luminous area on the second hand.  Hard to see in dim light.<br />b) better luminosity in general.  They are bright when you first go into a dark room but seem to fade fairly quickly, Basically, don't expect to wake up in the middle of the night and easily see the hands of the watch when it's on your nightstand.  There is some glow, but it is very faint, making it fairly hard for me to tell the time even when fully dark adapted. Maybe add red outlines on all the hands since the minute hand is much easier to see.<br />c) a domed crystal: this watch has a flat crystal and it does seem more reflective (see photo).  Have also read that domed are more durable, but I have not had any problems with durability of this one to date.<br />d) more watch band options:  I got the bund band and it seems it be of good quality and was comfortable but I also ordered a nato/zulu style band from Infantry Co., that I think looks sportier (see photo) and makes it less likely to drop the watch if a lug spring pin popped for any reason.  I will probably mainly use the nylon band.<br />Overall I think the watch is a good value (the other watches I had considered were Hamilton's that were considerably more expensive and did not have the screw in crown and therefore, were rated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.ated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.	2015-08-31

Getting on to reviewing the watch, a piece that hopefully will once again be in stock and available for sale again lest my review be in vain.<br /><br />It arrived and of course it was immediately sized, and resized and micro adjusted a few times, yes this is a watch and bracelet design that can be challenging to those not familiar with large heavy watches with SS bracelets, it's all about finding that sweet spot and then it's smooth sailing. I emphasize this because proper sizing and simple micro-adjusts can make or break your watch experience. Depending on the weather or season my wrist can vary quite a bit, so I size it as tight as possible with the links and then I'm able to easily adjust the band in small increments.<br /><br />Next up is the finish, wow what a finish it is! If you have a little OCD as I do you may want to keep a soft polishing cloth in your back pocket,lol but I am serious, it gets smudged very easily. About the extra &#34;clear coat&#34; as I like to call it, it acts much like the nickname I gave it. When I closed the safety clasp it was very tight and after 30+ uses I was pretty amazed to see that the finish was still holding firm, not even a scratch. Normally a watch that has a matte finish or SS will likely leave a good scratch on the clasp where the safety clamps down, not the case here. I've worn it A LOT over the first month and did several of my own rigorous quality control experiments which is, if you don't know, extremely important when dealing with Invicta. While my haphazardnesshas etched plenty of very fine hairline scratches, none of them even came close to the depth of the actual gold finish thanks to the clear coat polish.<br /><br />Finally, after all of that 30 day break in, the movement and chronograph have been 100% functional and the time is within one second from which I set it to on arrival, month date and snapback day of the week all working just fine. The Ronda 8040N is easily my favorite quartz movement. As for the flash of the finish, yea it's loud and blingy, not everyone can pull it off, but you guys can sort that kinda thing out for yourselves. As for me I love it. This marks my 7th higher end Invicta I've purchased in the last year and a half, all of them Swiss quartz and over that time every single watch is within 5 seconds of what I set it too. The bottom line is that Invicta's design team has been operating at a level of intricacy and making designs that are unrivaled in their beauty and function(when they do function;)har har, and this piece is proof of it. I really wish they would attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye by boosting QC and CS, but until then they will leave customers weary, even people like me who have had nothing but positive experiences and collectors alike can't help but to hope to heck they don't ever need to deal with Invicta's CS for warranty service, but enough of that, they know what needs improvement and as long as I continue to receive quality timepieces I'll remain I customer of Invicta.

I bought this as a replacement band for a Pebble Time and it works beautifully. It's a perfect match for the watch color and functions exactly as specified. The only minor drawback is with sizing: it's virtually impossible for anyone without the dexterity of an octopus to grasp two tiny screwdrivers and exert enough force to be able to unfasten the links. I ended up using a Swiss army knife blade to prevent one screw from turning and then unscrewing the other with a watchmaker's screwdriver.	2015-08-31

This one fills the bill as both an attractive and functional timepiece. The only negative comment I would share, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 relates to the description which indicates that this watch has a &#34;21-jewel, Japanese quartz analog automatic movement, with exhibition case back&#34;.  It is a Japanese quartz movement but does not have an exhibition case back, nor an automatic (self-winding) movement.	2015-08-31

This is a fantastically well-made, quality product.  Easily the best watch band I've ever owned!  Except for the fact that when I sweat the band stains my arm . I guess whatever they use to stain the leather didn't set properly or something.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it five stars.  The black finish had started wearing off the hardware,  but that just gives it charm I think.<br /><br />Update: I bought this watchband on August 16, 2015. I used it for one year and seven months before replacing it. I've changed this review from 3 to 4 stars based on the durability of the band over that time. The hardware held up without fault, aside from the loss of color. Towards the end the leather started showing it's age by cracking and stretching. This is forgivable since this band only cost a surprising $11 at the time. Arm staining continued for a few months before tapering off with no lasting effects. Overall, this was a really great value and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others.<br /><br />(Last three pictures are after 1yr 7mths of use)	2015-08-31

Honestly, I think this is what a Daniel Wellington should cost...<br />Pros: lightweight (forget it's on) and simplistic (easily matches w/anything).<br />Cons: Thinness of whole piece (makes it look a bit cheap), No second hand (Could be a preference, but also makes it look lifeless mad cheap/broken) It just seems like Made in China is written all over it.<br /><br />Reason to buy: this is the best price out there, and the best part of DW is the easily interchangeable straps, I would suggest buying a couple of 20mm Nato straps to add some variety to this purchase ($5-15). Make sure you get rose gold though.	2015-08-31

The SKX series are classic automatic watches and a great value.  These are the Kalashnikovs of the watch world - iconic styling, robust construction, but not terribly accurate.  Expect it to run +/- 10-20s per day and you won't be disappointed.  It can be regulated for much better accuracy - you can also learn to position the watch at night to make up or lose time as you need.  For me, that's part of the fun of an automatic.  It does not hack or wind if that's important for you.  Fit and finish is excellent in my opinion.  The case in particular is beautiful and you can easily trace it's evolution through an interesting lineage of Seiko divers back to the 60s.  My first (SKXA35) is still going strong after 10 years without ever being serviced (FYI it's marked mov't Malaysia same as the SKX173).  Even the Lumibrite lume and Hardlex crystal are like new.<br />I just bought this one for use as a daily 'beater' that isn't bright yellow.  I also really like the square indices, reminiscent of the old 6105 from my era...  The first watch that arrived had a misaligned chapter ring, bad enough my wife and kids could notice, so back it went.  The second watch is much better but not 100% perfectly aligned and the day/date sit low in the their window.  My wife and kids can't see it and think I'm crazy for insisting - so I kept it (but I know...).  For what it's worth, my old SKXA35 was/is perfect.  I don't know if QC has gone down hill or if I just got lucky on that one.  Anyway,  I do recommend buying 'Fulfilled Through Amazon' so you can take advantage of the easy returns if your particular watch doesn't cut it.<br />I might add that these are thickish watches at 13mm but wear well on smaller wrists.  Lug to lug distance is about 45mm, that's pretty short and I feel a better measure of fit on the wrist than diameter (42mm w/o crown).  I have a 6.25&#34; oval wrist and it feels fine and looks natural.  On a Strapcode oyster bracelet it feels wonderful and looks expensive.  On a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.	2015-08-31

It's a little more expensive than the main line of Gshocks but it more than makes up for it with its appearance. As others have said here, the colors are not pure orange and blue, but a tad washed out. The Japanese special edition has more vibrant color. I knew this before hand and chose this version as I think the colors stand out enough already to the point where you can't avoid seeing it and to go further would be a little obnoxious. It's big and colorful so it works well in places like dark bars, clubs, or anywhere else at night that isn't very dressy. The yellow roller on the side is a little overpowering on the watch but it adds a little childish character to the watch. It looks like something out of a cartoon or perhaps a nerf produce or a late 80s, early 90s watch. I will wear this over my Rolex when I'm out at night just because the colors can keep. Good buy and will easily last at least a decade like most Gshocks do.	2015-08-31

I got this watch because I always see  it posted online with rave reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't like the band initially, but it has come to grow on me. The watch comes with a ton of functions, I don't think I'll use them all except for the indiglo feature. On thing I was happy about was that this watch doesn't have the loud tick that so many Timex watches suffer from. I was able to snag this on sale, but I wouldn't mind paying full retail for this watch. If you are looking for a stylish daily driver, do yourself a favor and get this watch.	2015-08-31

This watch has the same look as what you would see on James Bond.  Extremely heavy-duty, but stylish at the same time (no laser beams or decoders included that I know of though).<br /><br />I've had a number of watches, but this one is by far the heaviest I've ever owned (not just heavy duty, but it physically weighs a lot).  So if you like the feeling of knowing you have the watch on your arm, then this is a great option.<br /><br />The readout has a lot of settings.  There are stopwatch capabilities, including lap timer, multiple different time zone readout options, and date.<br /><br />It does take a bit of time (no pun intended) to learn how to use this sophisticated watch.  But once you learn the basics, it is fairly intuitive.<br /><br />Be sure you get the chronograph version (unless you enjoy regularly winding the watch, or you're prepping for an EMC and you want a watch that won't stop working).<br /><br />The only notable downside - the many readouts, and the instruction manual, are tiny.  My eyes are starting to go and I can really only read the &#34;big hand, little hand&#34; parts without the aid of eyeglasses.  Even the date is too tiny for me to read without eyeglasses.  So one star removed because of my aging eyes.<br /><br />Also, unless your wrist exactly fits this watch, you'll likely be taking it to a jeweler to get a link or two removed in order to size it for your wrist (but that's the case with any high-end watch).	2015-08-31

This is a cool looking watch without going too far, the stainless steel case is well machined and solid, the offset 10 O'Clock crown is knurled making it easy to grip while adjusting. A Sapphire Crystal is strong preventing scratches much better than mineral glass that you'l find in many watches in this price range.  This watch comes in a shaped ballistic nylon case that zips the clam shell case closed keeping your watch safe when not being worn. The second hand extends the full 12 to 6 O'clock length, half of the second hand is red so its easy to keep track of. The ribbed soft rubber strap is light and comfortable, its shaped at the contact points helping to keep it from rolling around on your wrist. No rubber smell emitting from this strap. The hour and minuet hands have blue/Green luminous markers, they hold a good glow for longer than most showing Oakley cared about the details.	2015-08-31

It's so unique and I've gotten lots of compliments.<br /><br />Initially after ordering, I got a quick email with a shipping confirmation, and received the watch a few days later. It shipped inside a nifty little suede pouch with a button fastener, and I use it as a place to set my watch on my nightstand.  After I got it the first day and did a quick inspection, the watch was flawless with a really nice rose gold finish. The wood dial is stunning with the tmbr logo very tiny and understated. The crown clicks in and out precisely, and overall the watch feels like precision workmanship.<br /><br />The band is nice supple leather that breathes quite well, even when it's humid outside, and the buckle matches the rose gold watch case perfectly.<br /><br />This is all good news, because I'll probably buy another one. After a week of me wearing it, my wife decided she liked it so much that she claimed it for herself.  She has very tiny wrists, but I have to admit it looks great on her, too.	2015-08-31

This watch face is lovely and a quality piece of jewelry; however, the band is nothing to write home about.  I am glad the price of the watch was low, because I will need to replace the band.  The band where it goes through the pins is just folded over and glued.  I'm afraid that with sweat or very much daily wear, it would come apart and the watch would fall to the floor and possibly break, or worse yet, be lost.<br /><br />Keeping time does not seem to be an issue, and the movement is smooth.  The design is what attracted me to the piece and it is truly lovely.  If you make this purchase, just plan on either not wearing it often, or replacing the band so you can wear it more frequently.<br /><br />I would still recommend this watch at this price point.	2015-08-31

I'd never had an Invicta watch before, and certainly not one this large.  However, I've had it a few weeks and I've grown very attached to wearing it.  Until now it's only be Fossil and Timex brands for me.  The people I work with noticed it the very first day.  It's a large and in charge watch that also becomes a conversation piece when all else fails.<br /><br />I'd read lots of reviews from watch snobs who said the Invicta brand was cheap and didn't quite have the quality of watches that cost 5-10 times more than this watch.  I took all of that into consideration and I still purchased this watch.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'll be honest here, the reason I went looking for a better watch was because the watch I'd be wearing was so small compared to what my colleagues and management were wearing.  I studied the various sizes closely to make sure what I bought would fit my wrist based on my size and how I usually dress for work.<br /><br />Let me break it down a bit:<br /><br />Me:  5'9&#34;, large guy, 8&#34; wrist (possibly 8.5&#34;).  I wear a watch every day - at work and at home.  I don't dive, but didn't care - I liked the diver watches anyway.<br /><br />Initial impressions:  This watch is nice to look at and definitely catches the eye of others around you.  I'm usually not a &#34;flashy gold&#34; kind of guy but this is just enough to make a statement without looking like you are a rapper.<br /><br />Quality & Feel:  It's heavy compared to my other watches.  Larger, too.  It feels substantial on my wrist but I quickly got used to it being there.  The band is solid and has &#34;Invicta&#34; inscribed on one side and &#34;Grand Diver&#34; on the other.  It also has those porthole diver men on the north/south side of the face.  The crown sticks out a good amount.  The diver dial on the top is solid and clicks as you move it.  It's not flimsy at all - very sturdy.<br /><br />Movement:  I studied this a bit before purchasing.  The one I received had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.  Maybe all the newer models have that same movement - but I did read some articles where Invicta had been using a different movement in it.  Anyway, I like this automatic thing.  I wear the watch almost daily and it stays wound all on it's own.  Also, the underside of the watch has a clear window in it where you can see how it winds itself.  It's very nice and has a yellow part that swings about that has script writing on it.<br /><br />Setting the watch:  This was fairly simple.  I *did* have a problem figuring out how to set the date, but once I read the instructions (duh) it was fairly simple.  To save you time, you just unscrew the crown, pull it out one level (out of two) and dial in the date you want.  One note!!  I was an idiot and didn't pay attention to what time of day it was when I set the date, so I found the thing not changing the date when I expected it to, and then changing midday when I didn't want it to.  Since this watch does not show &#34;AM / PM&#34; , you kind of guess at the time of day when you set it.  Just move the clock forward 12 hours if yours is changing at the wrong time.  You'll figure it out.<br /><br />Sizing:  Ok, so even with an 8-8.5&#34; wrist, I had to remove links.  Ultimately I removed 4 links, but that made the watch a bit too snug for me, so I'll be adding one back in shortly.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this, or any other Grand Diver you happen to like.  I'm happy with it and considering the price point, I felt like it was a good balance between cost, quality, features, and style.eceived had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.

I see people wearing name brand watches that need their batteries replaced, some sub par glass materials, and you have to set the correct date every time the month falls short of 31 days and it's all for about the same price as this beauty. If youre looking for a classy time piece and don't mind the dual tone design this is your watch. You will not be disappointed. I gave it four stars due to the dual tone design,  other than that is a magnificent time piece.	2015-08-30

This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch band to be very well made, comfortable, and easy to adjust. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced, although it does not have a titanium bracelet.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna.	2015-08-30

Many economically-oriented watches on the market are either big, gawdy, blingy, littered with non-functional dials or downright aesthetically unpleasant. The Susenstone Wood Grain watch is none of that. The wood grain watch face is simply but provides a pleasant contrast against the black lettering of the watch. The movement itself is silent and accurate. The crystal surface is clear and free of defects, as is the shiny-brown stainless steel watch body. Straps are made of wood-grained leather though they do come from the factory feeling rather stiff, hence why I have it wrapped around a watch case cushion to help it form a more natural shape. Note the while needles are NOT photoluminiscent and you will not be able to read this watch in the dark, although that hardly seems to matter since this is more of a fashion watch as opposed to a multi-functional watch. I am very pleased to add this watch to my collection at a discount for review!	2015-08-30

I have only owned for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to performance quality. Will update if there are any concerns. But, here's so far:<br /><br />Appearance: The design is ***very nice***. Classic lines and dials; the overall look is like a modern twist to a traditional styling - sort of like Kenneth Cole clothing. The buttons are on the left - I've never seen that before. It is very eye-catching, and it is very BIG, but in the gray color (which I have), it's not over-done.<br /><br />Quality: I can't speak for long term performance, but the piece looks and feels like it is excellent, especially for the price. The band is genuine leather, and feels it, while it matches the watch color. Very pleased.<br /><br />Function: mine has kept perfect time so far. The chronograph (stopwatch) actually uses the large second hand, while the actual second hand is the small dial on the left; this is not my preference, but I've had that in a watch before. The numbers are clear and easy to read at a glance. The water resistance is sufficient for anything I plan to do with it on. In other words, splash, etc, but I'd take it off for swimming, showering, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very attractive, easy to read watch.	2015-08-30

Not sayin a man couldnt wear it tho, just tryna give an idea about the size. I dont think the face is real wood, and that was a bit of a let down since that's what seemed to make the watch. But i still think its cute so 3 stars	2015-08-30

The carbon fiber band is light and durable, the watch is somber and somewhat accurate for its functions. I was pleasantly surprised that with Premium Japan's quick delivery, and the packing with the watch. It is more expensive than the base model and my friend is just as satisfied with his base model. This watch suits a particular person criteria more than as general purchase or gift.<br /><br />Like<br />The negative display and other features listed<br /><br />Disliked<br />I can't seem to work out how to set the light to last more than 2 seconds for the display. It is missing some functions from the base model in terms of programming.<br /><br />Overall Happy with my purchase because it suits my needs.	2015-08-30

Love not having to change batteries!	Great fishing watch for inter-coastal fishing in St. Augustine, FL. I actually set it for Porpoise Point Beach because I fish the jetties across the bay where the tide is VERY VERY swift at incoming and outgoing tides. So, this helps greatly! It is also very rugged, I go fishing offshore almost every Tuesday and for several months was fishing a minimum of twice a week. Plus, I wear it every day because it looks OK and is accurate, I have not had to reset the time since I bought it.<br /><br />I also love the fact that I don't have to change batteries, because my last Casio fishing watch (Pathfinder PAS400B-5V) battery could not be replaced without sending it to the factory...and they couldn't even tell me how much it would cost to replace it until I sent it to the factory!!! Can you believe that rip-off?! AND it may have cost more than the watch! Plus the band broke and the replacement band, once again, would cost more than the watch! (Wow, I just discovered today that the watch I bought for $25.50 now sells for $248!! So, maybe I should get the battery replaced by the factory now and buy a new band! HA!)<br /><br />Anyway, back to this watch...I was concerned about being able to see the dial it in the sunlight and also concerned about it not staying charged indoors...but I was happy to discover that neither of those concerns were a problem. In fact, I press the night light several times a night with no problem at all!<br /><br />Also, I recommend downloading the Instruction guide from online because the one that comes with the watch is so small that I could barely read it. Plus you can search items of interest with the PDF, which makes it muuuuuuch easier to learn how to use it and set it up!!!<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it does not have the &#34;best fishing times&#34; by showing small fish on it like my last Casio fishing watch (PAS400B-5V).  In fact I searched for days to find a &#34;reasonably priced&#34; fishing watch withall three fishing aids...moon, tide and best fishing times and found none! If anyone finds one at a reasonable price please reply to this and I will buy it! (But, hmmmm I am not actually sure if I can read a reply.)<br /><br />FYI: I also purchased the Casio Men's Casual Sport Watch (W753-1AV) but did not like it because I could not read the tide chart well nor the moon phase especially in sunlight. In fact, I am not even sure the tide chart worked because it never showed the correct tide. Compared to this watch, the W753-1AV is very inferior in my opinion. But oddly, I see it has high ratings by others. (But, that may be because they have not owned both to compare.)<br /><br />Good fishing!	2015-08-30

I received this watch yesterday and automatically I wore it since I had two events to go to. My first impression of this watch,  very elegant and classy design. Love the beautiful color wristband. I was super excited to be wearing my new watch, until I actually went to put it on, too big for a small wrist, it only has 6 holes to adjust size, I needed to make 2 more so it could fit me. As the night went on, I needed to keep sliding down the strap to hold it in place, that unfortunately lead to the strap holder from detaching itself. Other than it being a pretty watch, I really feel the wristband quality is very cheap, but it's definitely one of those items that you get for what you pay type of thing. I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review.	2015-08-30

My husband loves the big, easy-to-read numbers on this watch. It is his go-to work watch because he can read the face without his glasses. He also has a Timex Ironman multi-lap/memory watch that he uses for running, but this is more ideal for day-to-day use. This is the second one that I have purchased for him in the past 10 years (normal wear-and-tear for him includes a broken band, scratched face and that general worn-out look, so we shopped for a new one and were delighted to find the same version still available). He loves it.	2015-08-30

But, it's worth it, in my opinion.	2015-08-30

Thus far, I like this watch a lot; it's solid, attractive, massive enough to feel like quality but not so heavy as to be a burden, and its size both suits my wrist and is neither too small to easily read the time nor so large that it catches on or bangs against things. My only complaint would be that my aging eyes would appreciate a larger day/date display, hence the deletion of one star; too often I must squint at it to make out what the day is (is that a 26 or a 28?) It's far too early (only 4 months so far) to judge how much savings there will be in batteries due to the solar charging feature, but if I get at least 5 years out of the original battery, I'll be happy (usually they last one to one and a half years each in non-rechargeable watches).	2015-08-30

This is a decent tool that (eventually) allowed us to do the necessary repairs on our watches. The space that holds the watch bands is almost large enough to fit most of our watches, although a few of my husband's watches were too wide to fit in the space. It comes with extra replacement bars and pins which was very nice since a couple have already broken. The biggest disappointment was that the first time we used this tool, it broke. It literally just snapped in half. Thankfully we were able to super glue it back together and we haven't had any problems using it since. The glue seems to be holding it together just fine, but it's really not fun to have an item break the first time you use it. So overall, the quality isn't fantastic, but we made it work and have been able to adjust the bands of several watches with it.	2015-08-30
