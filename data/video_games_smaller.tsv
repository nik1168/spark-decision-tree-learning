The automatic autherntication does not work and the offline setup doesn't either. The super secret code it generates does nothing. You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either. It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.<br /><br />Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version. I do not recommend wasting your time trying to get through Rockstar's DRM. Honestly you idiots, pirates will pirate. Regular users are the ones who get scred by DRM. When will you learn?	2015-08-31

I have ALWAYS adored the AC franchise and will continue to support Ubisoft for a long time to come. Let's face it, there are A LOT of Assassin's Creed games! My game shelf was over flowing so I decided to clean things up a bit, therfore, I sold my &#34;AC3 - AC4&#34; games to purchase this set. ( I had never owned AC Liberation before) It's cheaper and more convenient than buying each game separate for the new buyers! I guess the only thing I'm surprised were not included were the Expansion Packs/DLC for each game. These are NOT new games (AC 4 might be an acception) so I am somewhat surprised that Ubisoft continue to make players pay for these old expansion packs.	2015-08-31

This thing did NOT work. It's actually two pieces which - I assume - are supposed to fit together and then fit into your controller with the batteries inside. We got the pieces together, yay.

This stand with switchable dual fans helps keep your PS4 at optimal performance temps. Plus it adds dual charging stations for controllers and adds two extra USB ports. While this item comes with no instructions on setup it's still very easy to connect. Just know that this stand doesn't &#34;Lock In&#34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically it will not prevent an accidental overturn if you do not have it on a firm shelf.<br /><br />The dual fans make some noise but not enough to distract you over background noises. As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports. I found this stand to everything advertised and a well made 3rd party accessory for your PS4 for the price.	2015-08-31

Most likely if it wasn't that way it would work. I am trying to return it or get it replaced, I will try to remember to update yall if it works when i get another one.	2015-08-31

US	40751777	R3D7YPQQBVGRG5	B00IQCRKT8	575580052	Batman: Arkham Knight	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	Color commentary	There are some sports that are better live than on TV. Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldn’t get being at the game itself.<br /><br /> I’ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. It’s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments.<br /><br /> The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. It’s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city.<br /><br /> There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gotham’s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batman’s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batman’s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game.<br /><br /> The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so it’s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B.<br /><br /> The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but it’s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games.<br /><br /> The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batman’s mouth doesn’t move while speaking.<br /><br /> There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesn’t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldn’t be any more banter.<br /><br /> Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. It’s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batman’s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldn’t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile.	2015-08-31

This review is based on the game, not the contents (Boba Fett, etc..)<br /><br />I've been a fan of this series since the original (1.0),  and if you go for the the 3.0 starter set on any platform, you will soon find out just how well your money was spent. With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle.  Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen.  I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice.  The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground  to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know.  Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.<br /><br />Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything.  It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!<br /><br />The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy.  And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.<br /><br />Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie,  Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is!  Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two:  Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox.  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year,  including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga,  The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.<br /><br />With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:<br /><br />- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.<br />- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.<br />- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.<br />- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track,  train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?<br /><br />In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015.brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.
