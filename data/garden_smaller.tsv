In the past I've tried rearranging and deep cleaning, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, and even resorted to bug spray and then actually Bombing my basement with those nasty chemical bug fogger bomb things. None of those worked. After bombing the basement I did see a reduction for a while but within a year they were bad again. I just hate using poison in an area where we will be hanging out and that my children will be playing in and can't bring myself to do it again. It isn't good for us or my dog and I'm so glad I've found an alternative. My dog shows no reaction to the ultrasonic sounds and we humans definitely can't hear it. But something tells me those little buggers can because they have completely bailed. I haven't seen but one spider since a few days after putting this in the plug and he looked like he was confused and didn't know where to go lol. I ordered another for the other room in the basement and there they will stay forever.<br /><br />I highly recommend using these. They work better than any other remedy I've tried and there is no poison or residue. I don't have to continuously purchase sprays and this is going to pay for itself overt and over again. This it's definitely one off the best investments I've made. Best of all, we have our basement back! We even set up a little tent and had a sleepover in the basement this weekend to celebrate. I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />I did receive my unit free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion after using this in my own home.honest opinion after using this in my own home.	2015-08-31

I bought this as a gift for my mom and she is thrilled with it!  The feeder is already fully assembled in the package; it is just laying flat, so when you pick up the hanging wire, the mesh sides immediately slide into vertical position and it is already ready to hang.  No pieces to attach or lose.  Just make sure you buy the right kind of seed that is the correct size.  A small metal cover on the top slides out of the way to allow you to pour the feed right in; it fastens back into place with a hook. Couldn't be easier.  It took the birds a couple of days to discover the feeder and then it was a feeding bonanza that my mom loves watching.	2015-08-31

They ignored it for weeks. Flew by because they were curious but they never ever tried it out while I was watching.  I put out this cute, colorful carton and within 2 days I finally got a hummingbird curious enough to check it out. He comes back to visit several times a day and is a joy to watch. I decided to try placing the tube style feeder next to it to see if he will finally try it. Nope. Still ignores it and will only use the EZNectar. This is expensive, but I will continue to use it. It's very easy to use. I had a bit of trouble with it leaking. I soon realized that the red tube attachment needs to be screwed on perfectly straight or the carton will leak, little drops at a time. Great purchase and I will buy it again.	2015-08-31

Received shipment promptly. However all the seed potatoes promptly rotted in the ground also.  We have never had such an epic fail before. The potatoes I saved for seed from last year are thriving.

I bought two of these to use in my basement where I am building a photography studio. A lot of people are afraid of spiders and there are a lot in the basement. We've only had the house for a short time and it was empty for about two years before we bought it, so there was plenty of time for them to build up.  The basement is about 700 square feet, mixed finished and concrete. I put one of these in a general location and I put the other on an extension cord point directly at one of the problem sections.  I haven't seen any real change in the number of spiders. I still have to vacuum them up, and their webs when I have a model or a client over. Having the speaker aimed directly at the spot where they make their webs doesn't seem to make any difference and I have seen spiders sitting on the actual units.  I was very skeptical about these working, but the reviews were positive. There is no real way for me to tell if these are being partially effective, although, I have seen one or two wolf spider like species in our living room, but not in the basement, so it is possible that it works on that species and not any of the many species that live in my basement.	2015-08-31

Shaft, Model# 331977-0001-G1	Lawn and Garden	2	3	3	N	N	Poor Engine Replacement	Well, I'll Start By saying I bought this 21 HP Vertical shaft engine as a replacement for My 2006 John Deere riding tractor.  This engine was installed by a certified John Deere mechanic and seemed to be a good choice and upgrade in Hp from 19 to 21, but was I wrong in my choice.  My tractor has less than 55 hours on it in 2 years and one month and has been maintained since bought by the same mechanic but now has a blown head gasket, I just don't feel that I should have to spend $200.00 in repairs on an engine that cost $579.00 just over 2 years ago.  I come to find out that this series motor had a problem with this and that there are very many other people with the same problem and that Briggs / Intek just waited for them to fail before allowing their fix to be implemented.  The fix to this problem is to torque the head gasket to a higher torque rating than what it came out of the factory with which in most cases takes care of the problem, but not in all,,, as I have read that others have had the gasket blow again even after torquing it to the new recommended settings.  Personally I would not recommend this engine to anyone as Briggs does not want to help cover the costs involved in this repair, when it was their design problem to begin with, unless it is with-in the 2 Yr. warrantee, so buyer beware and be informed as this engine will cost you money at least every other year.

My first impression was WOW.  This thing is great.  After a few days its shown some weaknesses, but they are fairly minor.  For starters, this is WAY better than the Hayward ultra vac.  I have owned 3 of those and all I can say, is avoid them like the plague.  My most recent machine was a Polaris ATV F7.  It lasted 4 1/2 years with NO issues.  Loved it.  So of course they don't make it anymore.  Bad reviews on the model that replaced it, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  Pros - very easy to install, love the features like the easy clean out, and the spin top so that the hose doesn't get tangled.  Cons - only one, it climbs out of the pool and sucks air.  They said this was an excellent vertical climber, and they weren't kidding.  It's awesome to have the sides of the pool cleaned as well as the floor, my ATV was not very good at that, however, I don't like the fact that it sucks air into the pump every 15 minutes or so.  Have not had heavy leafing yet, but will soon.  I don't think this thing will do very well with leafs due to the clearance it has, but I'll re-post and let you know.  Other than that it does a fine job and does not get stuck anywhere, or tangle the hose up at all.  Make sure you are getting the 30gpm suction through your vacuum line and this thing will run like a champ.  If this holds up well without constantly having to replace parts, I will definitely stick with it.<br /><br />Ok it has now been about 20months of operation.  I dropped this from a 4 to a 3 because, like everything else pool manufacturers build these days, this is cheap plastic crap that has to be constantly replaced.  Hoses starting splitting apart at about 14 months in.  Over the last 6 months I have had to replace  every single section of hose (8) at 20 bucks a pop. So there goes 160 dollars.  Then the treads wore out and had to be replaced.  They were only 10, but that still puts me up to 170.00.  Now it spends all of it's time stuck in one corner or the other.  It used to never get stuck, now it's ALWAYS stuck.  So I assume some sort of drive is out.  I have not researched how much the drive assembly cost but even if its only 30 bucks (highly doubtful since a section of hose is 20) I'm up to 200.00.  Be better off to just buy a new one, which is exactly the point, seemingly, with all pool equipment manufacturers.  You either buy a new one every year or so, or you spend the equivalent replacing every cheap a## part that they build it with.  So, while its still way better than a Hayward ultra vac, I really can't endorse it.  Guess I'll keep searching for something that will actually last a few years and earn my loyalty.  This aint it.it spends all of it's time stuck in one corner or the other.  It used to never get stuck, now it's ALWAYS stuck.  So I assume some sort of drive is out.
